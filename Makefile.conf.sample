# This is probably the only config option you should need.  It basically sets which modules should be built
# when invoking make.  By default all is built.  You can get a complete list by invocing the following command:
#  awk -F'[ ,]' '/^ifneq .*mods/ { print $3}' < Makefile
#mods=server client marker admintools

# Whether or not to build the TEX documentation
#builddocs=yes
