NOTE: AbacusCM is not currently maintained, and several of the pinned
dependencies have known security vulnerabilities (which might or might not
impact AbacusCM). Use at your own risk.

The documentation is maintained in DocBook, in doc/docbook. It can be built
by running 'make docs' (or 'make htmldoc' or 'make pdfdoc' to build a subset).
