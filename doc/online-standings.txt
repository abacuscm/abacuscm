To generate online standings
----------------------------
Run bin/standings client.conf /path/to/standings.txt

You will be prompted for username and password. It will work with judge
or contestant, but it should be used with a dummy contestant to prevent
standings from leaking during the last hour.

It will write to the file specified on the command line (defaulting to
./standings.txt) every time there is an update.


The second part is the web-related files in misc/standings:

1. Copy standings.pl to a cgi-bin directory (if you have cgi-bin rights).
2. Copy the other files to a normal web server directory.
3. Tweak the settings at the top of standings.pl.
4. Make any tweaks to the HTML layout or the .css file to your taste (leave in
the magic HTML comments, which are used by the Perl script to fill in
content).
5. Ensure that the /path/to/standings.txt above is next to the non-CGI files.

Then point people at either the .pl file or the .html file. The .pl file
requires CGI, but has the advantage that it will work even without Javascript
enabled (but will not auto-update or have any nice animations). If you use the
.pl file, then the .html file is needed only to provide a template.

Note that the files in misc/standings/js are third-party and contains their
own licenses.
