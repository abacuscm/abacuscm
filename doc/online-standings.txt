To generate online standings
----------------------------
Run bin/standings client.conf /path/to/standings.txt

You will be prompted for username and password. It will work with judge
or contestant, but it should be used with a dummy contestant to prevent
standings from leaking during the last hour.

It will write to the file specified on the command line (defaulting to
./standings.txt) every time there is an update.


The second part is the Perl script misc/standings.pl. Copy it to a
cgi-bin directory, changing the hard-coded path to the standings.txt
file. No modules beyond CGI (quite standard) are required. There is
also a CSS file in misc/abacuscm.css.

You can also supply a file to make team IDs to team names; just modify
the hard-coded path in standings.pl. The file format is

teamid<tab>team name
teamid<tab>team name
