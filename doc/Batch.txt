The tool bin/batch is intended primarily for testing abacus itself, although
it can be used to automate tasks that would normally be done through the GUI,
and for which there is currently no command-line tool. It is invoked as

bin/batch <configfile> [<batchfile>]

The configfile is a client config file, as would be used by the abacus client.
The batchfile contains messages to send to the server. If omitted, standard
input is used instead.

Messages are specified in the form

type
key:value
key:value
.
.
.

There may optionally be a blank line between messages, but NOT within a
message. A blank line also flushes the current message, which may be
convenient if using it interactively. The valid types and their required
key-value pairs are not currently documented, but can generally be inferred
from the code in src/serverconnection.C. As an example, the first message will
generally be

auth
user:username
pass:password

in order to log in.

It is also possible to set content to send with messages. This can be done in
two ways:

1. Add a line of the form "<filename". This file will be sucked in and
appended to the content block of the message. This is suitable for use with
the submit message type.

2. Add a line of the form "key<filename". The file will again be sucked in an
appended to the content block, but a header line for "key" will also be
generated to indicate the location within the content block and the base
filename. This is suitable for use with the setprobattrs message type.

Note that if the file could not be read, it will be skipped, but the message
will still be sent.
