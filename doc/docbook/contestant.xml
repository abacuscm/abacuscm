            If you are uncertain about some details in a task or the contest

                    In a distributed (multi-site) contest, the judges might
                    not be on-site. Thus, if you have specific questions about
                    the installation at your site (e.g., your IDE won't open)
                    then speak to somebody at the site.

                    The judges do not know who is submitting queries. This
                    means that if you want to refer to a previous query you
                    made, you should include the <guilabel>Request
                        ID</guilabel> that appears in
                    the list box. Similarly, if your query is about a
                    particular submission, you should include the
                    <guilabel>Submission ID</guilabel> from the Submissions
                    tab (or use the <guibutton>Request

                    <xref linkend="contestant.submitting"/>). Even if you
                    include a submission ID, you still need to ask a specific
