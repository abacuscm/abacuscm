        <title>Generating certificates</title>
        <para>
            Abacus uses X.509 certificates to allow clients to check that they
            are connecting to a genuine server, and have not been subjected to
            a man-in-the-middle attack. To run a contest, you will need a
            certificate authority (CA) certificate, and a certificate per
            server signed by that certificate authority.
        </para>
        <para>
            Note that at present, the client will happily connect to any
            server that has a certificate signed by the CA. You should thus
            <emphasis>not</emphasis> have your server certificates signed by a
            public CA, as anyone else whose certificate has been signed by
            that CA would be able to accept connections from clients. Instead,
            you should generate your own CA certificate, and distribute
            <filename>cacert.crt</filename> to
            the clients (see <xref linkend="administrator.client"/>).
        </para>
        <para>
            To create the CA certificate, enter the <filename
                class="directory">certs</filename> directory and run
        </para>
        <screen><userinput>./makeca.sh</userinput></screen>
        <para>
            This will run for a while and then prompt for some details, you
            can mostly just fill in here whatever you want.  Be warned though
            that <parameter>Server Name</parameter> isn't exactly what you
            expect it to be. This is the CN field, and should probably be
            something like <userinput>AbacusCM CA</userinput>.
        </para>
        <para>
            Once you have created the CA certificate, you need to create a
            certificate for each server. Theoretically this could be done using
            certificate requests but this has not been implemented yet as
            <application>ssh</application> has proven adequate for
            distributing certificates securely.
        </para>
        <para>
            To create a key for a server you should use the
            <filename>addserver.sh</filename> script (in <filename
                class="directory">certs</filename>. This script takes a single
            parameter, the name of the certificate (usually a short name for
            the server) e.g.,
        </para>
        <screen><userinput>./addserver.sh <replaceable>pug</replaceable></userinput></screen>
        <para>
            This will create a key and a certificate request for
            <replaceable>pug</replaceable> and then proceed to sign that
            request with the previously generated CA.  Again, you can enter
            just about any details when prompted. You should however, enter
            the fully qualified domain name when asked for <parameter>Server
                name</parameter> (the name that users of the AbacusCM client
            will enter when connecting to the server). Also be sure to enter a
            <parameter>State or Province Name</parameter> or it will fail.
        </para>
        <para>
            When the script is done it will symlink the keys and certificates
            into <filename class="directory">certs</filename> as
            <filename><replaceable>servername</replaceable>.crt</filename> and
            <filename><replaceable>servername</replaceable>.key</filename>.
            You will need to set up the server configuration file to reference
            them (see <xref linkend="administrator.server"/>).

            you place the certificate at

            convention.

                Each server needs its own database. Currently only MySQL is
                supported as a database backend. The minimal set of privileges
                is not currently known, and so currently all privileges are
                given to the database user.
            </para>
            <para>
                Assuming the MySQL server is running on localhost, you can
                create the database as follows:
            </para>
            <screen><prompt># </prompt><userinput>mysql -u root -p -h localhost</userinput>

<prompt>&gt; </prompt><userinput>quit;</userinput></screen>
            <para>
                Once the database has been created you need to load the base

        <title>Configuring the markers</title>
        <para>
            The simplest way to install a marker is to run
            <filename>misc/installmarker.sh</filename> (this requires you to
            be <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>, and then edit
            the configuration file. Note that the installation process will
            create a group called <systemitem
                class="groupname">markerd</systemitem> and a setuid
            binary called <filename>runlimit</filename> that is executable by
            this group.
        </para>
        <para>
            The marker will need an Abacus account. You can create one though
            the GUI (using the <systemitem class="username">admin</systemitem>
            account, or you can use the command-line
            <command>adduser</command> tool:
        </para>
        <screen><userinput>bin/adduser <replaceable>abacus.conf</replaceable> admin <replaceable>adminpass</replaceable> \
    <replaceable>marker1</replaceable> "<replaceable>Marker A</replaceable>" <replaceable>markpass</replaceable> marker</userinput></screen>
        <para>
            There are several configuration file options you will need to
            change:
        </para>
        <procedure>
            <step>
                <para>
                    In the <literal>[server]</literal> section, configure
                    <parameter>address</parameter> and
                    <parameter>cacert</parameter> as described in <xref
                        linkend="administrator.client"/>. Also set the
                    <parameter>username</parameter> and
                    <parameter>password</parameter> to the Abacus marker
                    account. You can use the
                    same account for several marker machines, but
                    troubleshooting will be easier if each marker machine uses
                    its own account.
                </para>
            </step>
            <step>
                <para>
                    In the <literal>[compilers]</literal>,
                    <literal>[java]</literal> and <literal>[python]</literal>
                    sections, configure the paths to the compilers and
                    interpreters. The <literal>[java]</literal>
                    <parameter>policy</parameter> must point at the policy
                    file provided with the abacuscm source bundle.
                </para>
            </step>
            <step>
                <para>
                    In the <literal>[marker]</literal> section, the
                    <parameter>workdir</parameter> is used as the argument to
                    <function>mkdtemp</function>. If the marker has lots of
                    spare memory, it would make sense to use a <systemitem
                        class="filesystem">tmpfs</systemitem> filesystem.
                    Additionally, <parameter>runlimit</parameter> must be set
                    to the path to the <filename>runlimit</filename> binary.
                </para>
            </step>
        </procedure>
        <para>
            The marker can be run under a normal user account, as long as that
            user is in the <systemitem class="groupname">markerd</systemitem>
            group. Since members of this group can run the
            <filename>runlimit</filename> setuid binary, only trusted users
            should be placed in this group.
        </para>
        <para>
            Once everything is configured, the marker is started by running
        </para>
        <screen><userinput><command>markerd</command> <optional><replaceable>marker.conf</replaceable></optional></userinput></screen>
        <para>
            This will connect to the server and mark solutions. If the
            connection fails, it will automatically reconnect to the server.
            If the file <filename>/etc/abacus/marker.conf</filename> exists,
            it is used to obtain options regardless of whether a configuration
            file is provided on the command-line. If both are present, options
            in the command-line configuration file take precedence.
        </para>
        <para>
            The marker is designed to have only one instance running on a
            system. It is possible to run multiple instances by using a
            different configuration file for each instance, with different
            users and groups (to prevent marked solutions from interfering
            with each other). This is not recommended, as solutions undergoing
            evaluation may contend for memory bandwidth or CPU execution
            units, making timing less accurate.

            The <command>standings</command> is used to generate standings that
            can be viewed from a web browser, with automatic updates. To set
            this up, follow these steps:

                    where <replaceable>/www-data</replaceable> is the

                        linkend="administrator.online-standings.non-cgi"/>. If
                    the filename is omitted, it will write to
                    <filename>standings.txt</filename> in the current
                    directory.
                </para>
                <para>
                    This will prompt you for a username and passwork to
                    connect to the server. You can use any account, but the
                    standings display will be whatever that account is
                    authorised. Thus, if you want the online standings to
                    reflect the contestants' view, use a dummy contestant
                    account.

            You can now point a web browser at either
            <filename>standings.pl</filename> or
            <filename>standings.html</filename>.
            The former requires CGI, but has the advantage that it will work
            even without Javascript enabled (but will not auto-update or have
            any nice animations). If you use <filename>standings.pl</filename>
            file, then <filename>standings.html</filename> is needed only to
            provide a template.

                The complete error message would read:

                    ack_id == 0 cannot possibly be correct.  This could
                    potentially happen if/when a server did not initialise
                    properly upon first creation (the first PeerMessage a
                    server receives must be its own initialisation message.
                    Please see the administrator's manual for more
                    information.

                Abacus sends the message to create a particular server to that
                particular server directly after creating that server.  It does
                this from all existing servers to increase the chances of this
                message getting through as it is of critical importance that
                this is the first message to get there.

            <para>
                Unfortunately if this should fail it will mean that there is no
                way to ensure that it is that particular message that gets
                re-sent (well, not that I'm aware off &mdash; other than to
                perhaps connect a priority to the NoAcks).  Consequently the
                servers that are up will tend to send some other message upon
                reconnect.  There are two possibly ways to "fix" this.

                    <para>Delete the records from <database
                            class="table">PeerMessageNoAck</database> that
                        refers to PeerMessage records earlier than that of the
                        <type>addserver</type> message.  You need to know
                        exactly what the message id is for this to work.  This
                        can be done on a live running server.  If you only had
                        one server up and running, you need to put these
                        records back when you are done.  This can be done with
                        the SQL statement:

                        where <replaceable>server</replaceable> is the numeric
                        id of the server to be added.  This will cause too many
                        messages to be resent, but your server will be up.

                    <para>
                        You can put a record into the <database
                            class="table">Server</database> table on the
                        affected server, i.e., the one that does not want to
                        initialise.  This record needs to contain the correct
                        name and ID of the server.  This part can be done on a
                        running server.  The processing of the
                        <type>addserver</type> message will fail.  This is
                        non-critical (in this case).  Shut down the server,
                        delete the added record and restart the abacus daemon.
                        All should now be well.
