Running an AbacusCM Client
**************************

Abacus tries to read it's config from three locations:

1.  /etc/abacus/client.conf
2.  ~/.abacus
3.  abacus.conf (current directory)

In that order.  It always tries to read all three, thus settings in later files
can override settings in earlier files.  Mostly you shouldn't need to change
much in the config file.

It is suggested to copy your cacert file into /etc/abacus then copy
conf/client.conf into /etc/abacus as well.  Then update client.conf, and
specifically the server section to contain the absolute path to to cacert.crt
(/etc/abacus/cacert.crt).  You may also want to update the address= line to
point to your server.

Once that is done you should simply be able to fire up abacus and it should
just work (Tm). Note that you need to put libabacus-client.so and libabacus.so
from the lib/ directory together with abacus from the bin directory.

The way I run my development copies is to run everything from the base of the
source.  In other words, the same location where you would run make.  For the
client I then symlink ~/.abacus -> conf/client.conf (obviously with a
more complete path) and then if you type bin/abacus then it just so
happens that certs/cacert.crt is in the correct location.
