Compiling AbacusCM
******************

AbacusCM does not make use of the autoconf tools like most other OSS projects.
This is (was) due to both lack of knowledge and time.  AbacusCM builds directly
using GNU Make and all tweaking needs to happen by either editing the Makefile,
or by overriding the variables from the command line.

Before you can compile AbacusCM you need the following pieces of software
installed:

* g++ (3.3.x and 3.4.x works, 4.x.x should also work).
* Qt3
* boost (specifically shared_ptr - only required for server).
* OpenSSL (Any version should work).
* MySQL 4.1.x (Whilst in theory any RDB could work currently only MySQL is
    supported - only required for server).

If everything is correctly installed and configured then typing "make" in the
top directory will compile AbacusCM, including the server, client, markers,
and support libraries and modules. Running 'make client' will built just the
client software. If pkg-config picks up the wrong version of Qt (e.g. Qt4)
then set QTDIR to the root of the Qt3 installation.

Binaries will be places in bin/, libraries in lib/ and modules in modules/.

Once everything compiles you will most probably want to proceed with setting up
a test (or as well call it, a mock) contest.  See "Creating_a_Contest.txt" for
more information.
