This directory contains some tools to quickly bring up a sample contest for
development purposes. It should NOT be used for production, because it has
hard-coded keys and passwords. For the same reason, the contest it creates is
only accessible from localhost.

The dependencies are Docker Engine and Docker Compose. After building the
docker image, run

- docker-compose up -d
- ./add.sh

You need to leave about 10 seconds between the steps for the server to come up
and be ready to accept commands. This creates a contest with some problems and
users, and sets it running for 50000 hours.

To blow away the whole thing, run
- docker-compose stop
- docker-compose rm

If you leave off the second step, it's possible to restart with the transient
data intact by running docker-compose up -d again.
